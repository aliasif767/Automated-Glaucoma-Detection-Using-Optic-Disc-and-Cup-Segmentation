# Automated-Glaucoma-Detection-Using-Optic-Disc-and-Cup-Segmentation
 Developed an automated glaucoma detection system using CNNs and U-Nets to segment the optic disc and cup from  retinal fundus images. The system calculates the Cup-to-Disc Ratio (CDR) for early diagnosis, achieving high accuracy on  the ORIGA dataset. Performance was evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and IoU
