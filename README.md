# Glaucoma-Detection
The code implements a U-Net architecture for segmenting optical disks and cups from the image and then finding CDR to diagnose Glaucoma

#Chosen Deep Learning Architecture:
The chosen architecture is U-Net. U-Net is particularly effective for biomedical image segmentation tasks due to its ability to capture both local and global features through a contracting path followed by an expansive path. It consists of a contracting path (downsampling) followed by an expansive path (upsampling) to achieve precise segmentation.
